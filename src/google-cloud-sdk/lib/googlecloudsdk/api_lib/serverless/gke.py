def MonkeypatchGetaddrinfo(hostname, ip):
  """Change getaddrinfo to allow a "fake /etc/hosts" effect.

  GKE provides an IP address for talking to the k8s main, and a
  ca_certs that signs the tls certificate the main provides. Unfortunately,
  that tls certificate is for `kubernetes`, `kubernetes.default`,
  `kubernetes.default.svc`, or `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`.

  This allows us to use one of those hostnames while still connecting to the ip
  address we know is the kubernetes server. This is ok, because we got the
  ca_cert that it'll use directly from the gke api.  Calls to `getaddrinfo` that
  specifically ask for a given hostname can be redirected to the ip address we
  provide for the hostname, as if we had edited /etc/hosts, without editing
  /etc/hosts.

  Arguments:
    hostname: hostname to replace
    ip: ip address to replace the hostname with
  Returns:
    A context manager that patches socket.getaddrinfo for its duration
